At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51,
               names_to = "Year",
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c('Gross capital formation',
                              'Exports of goods and services',
                              'General government final consumption expenditure',
                              'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)',
                              'Imports of goods and services')) %>%
  mutate(Value = Value/1e9) %>%
   mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(IndicatorName == 'Gross capital formation' ~ 'Gross capital formation',
                 IndicatorName == 'Exports of goods and services' ~ 'Exports',
                 IndicatorName == 'Imports of goods and services' ~ 'Imports',
                 IndicatorName == 'General government final consumption expenditure' ~ 'Government expenditure',
                 IndicatorName == 'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)' ~ 'Household expenditure'))

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r plot1, out.width="100%"}

GDP_components_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  mutate('Components of GDP' = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c("Gross capital formation",
                                "Exports",
                                "Government expenditure",
                                "Household expenditure",
                                "Imports")))


ggplot(GDP_components_data, aes(x= Year , y= Value, colour = `Components of GDP` , group = `Components of GDP`), size=0.8) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  theme_bw()+

       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD", 
       y = "Billions US$") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())


```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 


The chart  allows us to compare the composition of GDP between the countries over time. Overall, the percentage contribution of the components seem to be similar across the three countries, with household expenditure accounting for the majority of GDP and net exports accounting for the least.There are time when GCF plays a more important role relative to government expenditure and vice versa, this seems to depend on country specific dynamics. 

India shows the greatest variation in the contribution of different components, specifically household expenditure and GCF. In the 70's India relied heavily on household expenditure, which contributed more than 70% of the GPD - significantly higher than in the US or Germany. Over time this has decreased to roughly 55% of GDP, with GCF making up a large portion of the difference. India's growth over the last 30 years has attracted a vast amount of investment which has taken the pressure off consumption to uphold the Indian economy. This was not the case in Germany and the US as both countries had already experienced rapid economic growth, therefore could not attract the amount of investment needed to alter to composition of GDP. 

All three countries roughly exported as much as they imported in 1970, however, only Germany runs a trade surplus today. The US net exports contributes roughly negative 5% of GDP, by far the most negative of the three countries. Germany's strong manufacturing sector ha lead the way allowing them to run a surplus for the last 20 years.
